# COVID-19
Exploratory Data Analysis using open source datasets such as NYT
I'm using an open-source dataset available from the New York Time: 'https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/raw/master/us-states.csv'
The aim is to generate simple charts to visualize and help us understand the trend of infection growth / decrease.

I'll try to update and comment the code regularely, nonetheless, it should be clear to the reader. Happy to answer any questions.
